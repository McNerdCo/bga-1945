  # Triggers the workflow at 2:22 am every morning, Github says that scheduled actions can be delayed if placed directly on the hour
  # so I moved it to 22 minutes past the hour
  schedule:
    # * is a special character in YAML so you have to quote this string
    - cron:  '22 2 * * *'

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
